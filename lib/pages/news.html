  <div class="postTime">posted Apr 6th, 2019 by <a href="/scawful">Scawful</a></div>
  <p>Alright so now we have reached a point where most of the social network features I wanted implemented are available. I've put strikethroughs all the stuff I finished below. I won't touch it again after this because the remaining features are quite large. Now these features are implemented but the styling could use some work and there's always possible bugs laying around. The next thing to complete will be the email verification and character class creation page. This will lead to the creation of all the rpg tables and the beginning of the stats information on the profiles. Legacy accounts will have default classes made for them and then new users will have a much cooler registration process.</p>

  <p>Everything is going smoothly as of right now. We are still early on in the projects lifespan but we now have added the following features.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>nginx profile page redirect, no any url not ending in backslash without an extension is parsed as a profile eg <a href="/scawful">/scawful</a></li>
      <li>Post to user profile with AJAX and Bootstrap Modal</li>
      <li>Send friend request, remove friends, respond to requests</li>
      <li>Added the <a href="?privacy">privacy policy</a></li>
      <li>Functional delete posts button</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>Remember though, your posts are never truly deleted. Only marked as deleted for now. So don't think you can post anything stupid and then hide it. I'm watching this database during development.</p>

  <p>The newest project for Zeniea is under development as of now! Well, two days ago. It took me a bit to be one hundred percent certain on what I wanted to do here, and I believe I have found it. As of right now I have made the following.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>login and registration script with Google reCaptcha</li>
      <li>password_hash and password_verify (thx randomguy)</li>
      <li>session information and profile page started</li>
      <li>new footer with information pages and links to blog, zelda, below</li>
      <li>user profile sidebar and timeline post form</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>I have a much stronger grasp at programming and scripting than I have ever before and am confident in this being one of my first complete adult projects. It will be made using PHP, MySQL, and Javascript. Once the code is a bit more presentable I will start pushing updates onto GitHub or something.</p>

  <p>I honestly think I am broken at this point. I completely remade the homepage from the blue space look back in the purple stylesheet I was at before. Now the html itself is a little cleaner though. I've decided that I'm going to change the way I approach web development so I stopped making a bunch of php files in the root and now I'm working with a template on the homepage made with CSS Grid and some PHP so it's kind of modulated. I've brought the Oracle of Secrets article to the homepage, and will be turning the other page into a blog for development. I don't always have a ton of time for the game but I should put updates somewhere consistent.</p>
